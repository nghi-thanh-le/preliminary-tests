This is the solution for the preliminary-tests , basic-html5 section

I believe you already have node installed at your machine. Before checking the process, if you don't install gulp and browser-sync package, 
please do it. 
```
  npm install -g gulp browser-sync
```

When you're done , simply run node command
```
  npm install
```
 to make sure you install dependencies... 
 
 To start the project, please run node command
 ```
  npm start
 ```
 if your browser is not opened automatically, please open your favourite one and go to localhost:3000.
